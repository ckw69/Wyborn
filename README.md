Why did i make this ?
- Because redblue wyvern has a drainer so i removed it and replaced everything with mine so he can't do anything if he wants to.

Why can i trust your wyborn doesn't have drainer or logger ?
- I don't really know alot about lua but can at least somewhat read and understand it, which means i won't be able to add a drainer and the code is all open sourced (used to be for around 2-3 months). I also have no reason to add a drainer or logger.

Why did you obfuscate it ?
- Was told that wyborn was a more powerful version of wyvern (and yes it is), so I obfuscated it, to not let it fall in the wrong hands, and maybe, make it only limited to certain users in the future (probably won't happen).

Why name it wyborn ?
- Wyvern + reborn = wyborn
